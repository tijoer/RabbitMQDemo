⬅️ [Previous Slide](1.md) | ➡️ [Next Slide](3.md)

## **Core Components:**
- **Producer:** 📨 Sends messages to RabbitMQ.
- **Queue:** 🗂️ Stores messages until they are processed.
- **Consumer:** 📥 Receives and processes messages.
- **Exchange:** 🔀 Routes messages to queues based on routing rules.

## **Message Flow:**
1. **Producer** ➡️ sends a message to an **Exchange**.
2. The **Exchange** routes the message to the appropriate **Queue**.
3. **Consumers** fetch messages from the **Queue** and process them.
