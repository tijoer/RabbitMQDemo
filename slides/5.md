# 🔧 Working with RabbitMQ
⬅️ [Previous Slide](4.md) | ➡️ [Next Slide](6.md)

## Setting Up RabbitMQ 🚀

1. **Install RabbitMQ** on your server.
   - Follow the [official installation guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).
   - There is no easy way. I cannot stress enough to read this.

2. **Start the RabbitMQ server**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
   ```

3. ***Enable the RabbitMQ Management Plugin***:
    ```bash
    sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
    ```

4. **Basic Commands** 💻

    ```bash
    # List queues
    rabbitmqctl list_queues

    # Publish a message:
    rabbitmqadmin publish routing_key=test message="Hello World!"

    # Consume a message:
    rabbitmqadmin get queue=test requeue=false

    # rabbitmqadmin is a python cli tool that will be missing in a basic install. In this demonstration we will use curl instead to work with the REST API, as this should be closer to our use case.

    ```
