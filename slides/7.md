⬅️ [Previous Slide](6.md) 

## What is the Management Console? 🛠️

- The **RabbitMQ Management Console** is a web-based UI that provides real-time insights and control over your RabbitMQ server.
- It allows you to **monitor** exchanges, queues, bindings, and connections, as well as **manage** users, permissions, and vHosts.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Dashboard Overview**: Get a high-level view of your RabbitMQ server, including message rates, node health, and more.
- **Queue Management**: View, purge, or delete queues; inspect messages; and manage queue settings.
- **User & Permission Management**: Easily create users, assign permissions, and manage vHosts.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track message rates, resource usage, and see live data streams.
- **Exchange & Binding Management**: Create, delete, and inspect exchanges and bindings.

## Accessing the Management Console 🚀

1. **Enable the Management Plugin**:
   ```bash
   sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management 
   ```

2. ** Access the Console**
    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:15672/.
    Login with the default credentials:
    Username: guest
    Password: guest

    However if you do not access the console from the same host, your request gets denied. So make sure you added your own user and granted access rights to your vhost. You can do it like this:

    ```bash
    rabbitmqctl add_user username password
    rabbitmqctl set_user_tags username administrator
    rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p vhost_name username ".*" ".*" ".*"
    ```
