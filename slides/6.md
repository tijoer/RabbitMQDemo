## What are vHosts? 🏢

- **Virtual Hosts** (vHosts) are a way to **segregate** different environments within a single RabbitMQ instance. They act as **containers** for exchanges, queues, and bindings.
- Each vHost can have its own set of **permissions**, allowing you to manage access on a per-environment basis.

## Why use vHosts? 🤔

- **Isolation**: Keep environments (e.g., development, staging, production) separate.
- **Security**: Apply different permissions to different users for each vHost.
- **Organization**: Manage resources more effectively by grouping related queues and exchanges together.

## Creating a vHost 🛠️

**Create a new vHost**
   ```bash
   # create the vhost
   rabbitmqctl add_vhost my_vhost

   # set permissions for a user 
    rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p my_vhost username ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

In the default installation is a vhost called "/". However I had some problems working with it, so I suggest, that you create your own vhost.
