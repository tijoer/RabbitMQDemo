# 🐰 RabbitMqDemo

**This is a RabbitMQ Demo project. To get started, please run the `main.sh` script.**

## 📖 Overview

This demo showcases how to set up and use RabbitMQ for message queuing. It includes examples of producing and consuming messages. By running the `main.sh` script, you will start the RabbitMQ server and execute the demo scripts to see RabbitMQ in action. The script will set up three containers that form a cluster.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Start a GitHub Devcontainer.** I suggest running four cores.
