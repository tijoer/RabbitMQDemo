# RabbitMqDemo
This is a RabbitMQ Demo project. To get started, please run the `main.sh` script.

## Overview

This demo showcases how to set up and use RabbitMQ for message queuing. It includes examples of producing and consuming messages. By running the `main.sh` script, you will start the RabbitMQ server and execute the demo scripts to see RabbitMQ in action. 
The script will set up three containers that form a cluster.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Start a Github Devcontainer. I suggest running four cores.
